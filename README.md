# Real-time-Data-Processing-with-Apache-Kafka-and-Apache-Spark
Processing real-time data streams by integrating Apache Kafka for data ingestion and Apache Spark for real-time data processing. Here's an overview of the project.

The project titled "Real-time Data Processing with Apache Kafka and Apache Spark" involves processing real-time data streams by integrating Apache Kafka for data ingestion and Apache Spark for real-time data processing. Here's an overview of the project:

Objective:
The aim of this project is to set up a pipeline for real-time data ingestion using Apache Kafka and process this data stream using Apache Spark's Streaming API. The processed data can then be further analyzed or stored for downstream applications.

Key Components:
Data Ingestion with Apache Kafka:

A Kafka producer is set up to simulate real-time data generation. This producer sends random data, including an ID, a random value, and a timestamp, to a Kafka topic (real-time-data).
The Kafka producer runs in a loop, generating new data every second and sending it to the Kafka server for real-time processing.
Real-Time Data Processing with Apache Spark:

Spark Streaming is used to consume and process data from the Kafka topic in real time.
A PySpark DataFrame is created with the streamed data, and basic filtering operations are performed, such as filtering records where a random integer value exceeds a threshold.
Additional data transformations, such as grouping and calculating averages, are performed on the data for further analysis.
Data Processing:

The incoming data is grouped based on a particular field, and aggregate functions such as calculating the average of a numerical field are applied to the grouped data.
DataFrames are used in PySpark to display filtered and processed data.
Technologies Used:

Kafka: For setting up real-time data streaming.
PySpark: For data processing and transformation in real time.
Python: For scripting and data manipulation.
Project Workflow:
Data Generation: A Python script generates random data (including IDs, random values, and timestamps).
Data Ingestion: Kafka acts as a broker, ingesting the generated data into a topic.
Data Processing: Spark Streaming reads the real-time data from Kafka, processes it using PySpark, and applies transformations like filtering and aggregation.
Data Output: The processed data can be visualized or stored for further use.
Conclusion:
This project showcases the integration of Apache Kafka and Apache Spark for real-time data streaming and processing. It demonstrates how to handle and analyze real-time data using distributed systems, making it ideal for applications like monitoring, alerting, or real-time analytics. ​​
